# Final-project
One of the challenges many international students in United States face when looking for a job is
not being able to find one that is sponsored by a visa and understanding expectations of
a salary. The Geo Jobs Insights application for International Students is designed to
produce interactive job location insight based on worksite and wage related attribute using
data like workforce and wage. Here students can analyze job opportunities, look at salary
trends, and be able to see how employers have sponsored them.
